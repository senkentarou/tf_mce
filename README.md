# Minimum Classification Training on Tensorflow
 * This is an implementation of Minimum Classification Error (MCE) Training on Tensorflow in Python .
 * This implementation was refered the algorithms in the paper of [Discriminative learning for minimum error classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/175747/) .

### Running environments
 * macOS High Sierra version 10.13.4
 * Python 3.6.2 (on pyenv-virtualenv)

### Setting up the running environments
 1. Install Python libraries by requirements.txt on pip .

 ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

 2. Execute tf_mce_***.py .

 ```
 python tf_mce_prototype.py
 ```

 * Training and testing samples are located in ./datasets/GMM.dat
 * There are generated by ./dataasets/generate_GMM_dist.py .
   If you want to generate datasets by yourself, please change GMM variables (mean, covariance, etc..) on this file .
